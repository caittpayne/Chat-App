# Chat App

Chat App is a chatroom application, similar to Slack, where participants can create channels and message each other. Users sign in using their Gmail credentials and their information is saved automatically to the application.

Additional features include editing messages and rooms, assigning admin users, and creating private channels for authorized users. Admin users have the unique ability to create these private rooms, as well as give other users administrative privileges.

## Motivation <a id="motivation"></a>

Chat App was my second project using React and was my first experience using a Firebase Database. My goal for the project was to expand my knowledge on my previous React experience, as well as learn the basics of Firebase databases. I really enjoyed working with Firebase and found it user friendly and interesting. I wanted to challenge myself to add features that I wasn't comfortable with, as well as implement features I knew would be more user-friendly.

This was also my first experience with Reactstrap. I have used Bootstrap in the past, but wanted to explore using another framework - one that didn't manipulate the DOM directly, a big "no-no" in React. At first, I considered using React-Bootstrap, but since this framework is based on Bootstrap v3, I opted to use Reactstrap (v4).
